# Salary-Estimator-in-HRMS-Payroll-Module-Using-ML-and-Power-BI-Dashboard-Creation
Developed a Salary Estimation Module in HRMS, utilizing Machine Learning Algorithms and Power BI dashboards to analyse salary trends, identify key factors, and deliver actionable insights.

 **Models insights:**  
 **Random Forest** provides robust predictions by aggregating decision trees, accommodating non-linear relationships for accurate salary estimation.  

 **Multiple Linear Regression** offers clear coefficient interpretations, beneficial for understanding linear feature-salary relationships, but it may falter with complex data. 

  **Lasso Regression's** regularization aids in feature selection, enhancing interpretability, especially valuable for high-dimensional datasets.  

Outline:  
1. Feature Importance: 
This insight can help in understanding what factors are crucial in determining an individual's salary, such as years of experience, education level, specific skills, etc.

2. **Salary Distribution:** Gain insights into the distribution of salaries across different segments.
   
3. Model Performance Comparison: This insight can help in determining which model performs best under various circumstances and which factors contribute to its performance. 

4. **Trends and Patterns:** This could include understanding how salaries vary over time, geographic locations, or industries.

5. **Outlier Detection:** Identify outliers in the salary data and understand the reasons behind them.
   
6. **Feature Relationships:** Explore relationships between different features and salaries.
   
7. **Model Interpretability:** Gain insights into how each ML model makes predictions. This insight can provide valuable information about the underlying factors driving salary predictions.

8. **Interactive Exploration:** Provide users with the ability to interactively explore the data through filters and slicers in the Power BI Dashboard.

9. Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations based on the insights gained from the analysis.  

Dashboard Creation: 
 Develop an interactive dashboard to visualize key Salary Estimators and to gain insights derived from the analysis.
